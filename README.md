# NeuralNetworkFromScratch

This repo is inspired Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid.
The dataset used can be found at: https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/

This is a simple implementation of a Neural Network that contains a single hidden layer using python. 

Some parts of the code (like reading in the input) prioritize simplicity over efficiency. The goal is to demonstrate how the learning process works for a Neural Network, and how it can easily be implented in a vectorized manner.

Some parts are hardcoded and may be updated in the future to be modular.
